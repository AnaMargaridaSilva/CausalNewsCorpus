# CASE-2022 Event Causality Subtask 1 - Evaluation Script

## Submission instructions
The script takes one prediction file as the input. Your submission file must be a JSON file which is then zipped. We will only take the first file in the zip folder, so do not zip multiple files together.

{"index": 0, "prediction": 1}<br>
{"index": 1, "prediction": 0}<br>
...

A sample file is available [here](). Also, make sure that the index order in the submission file is the same as the 
order in the original test data.
